# TicTacToe IOS App

<h3>Game description</h3>
<h5>
This application is a basic basic 2 player Tic Tac Toe game for IOS. Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game in which the two sides compete to be the first to place 3 Xs(crosses) or Os(nougts) in on the board in a straight vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.</h5> 


<h3>Technologies used</h3>
I made use of Xcode to design the app, which was written in the Swift language with a Storyboard interface. This is my first attempt at designing an IOS app, so the above technologies were selected to allow for a beginner friendly learning experience.
